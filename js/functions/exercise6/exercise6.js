*/

//book solution
/*
The function name is multiplyNumbers.

The function arguments are the values 2, 3, and 4 between the parentheses on line 6. The function parameters are num1, num2, and num3 on line 1.

The function body consists of everything between the { on line 1 and the } on line 4. It doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the braces as part of your answer.

The function declaration is everything on lines 1-4. The function invocation is multiplyNumbers(2, 3, 4) on line 6.

The function's return value is determined by multiplying the arguments together. That value is initially stored in the local variable result in the function's body. It gets assigned to product after the function returns.

This code's complete list of variables includes multiplyNumbers, num1, num2, num3, result, and product. In particular, the function name and its parameters are all variables. In this case, multiplyNumbers is a global variable, but num1, num2, and num3 are local variables defined inside the function.
